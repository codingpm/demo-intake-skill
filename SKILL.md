description: Clarify incomplete prototype requests before UI generation for both web and mobile products. Use when the user wants a page, screen, or prototype but has not provided enough detail about the platform, page type, target users, business object, goals, key actions, fields, or constraints. Ask one question at a time, stop within 8 questions, then produce a structured requirement brief for downstream design skills.

# Demo Intake Skill

Use this skill before generating a prototype when the user's request is too brief, vague, or missing important product context.

This skill supports both web and mobile prototype requests.

Its role is not to produce the final UI by default. Its job is to clarify the request, reduce ambiguity, identify the correct platform and page structure, and convert the conversation into a structured requirement brief for downstream design skills.

## Supported Targets

This skill can prepare briefs for:

- web admin pages
- web business systems
- mobile business apps
- mobile operational screens
- multi-platform prototype requests

Typical downstream skills include:

- `th-b-web-ui-skill`
- `th-b-mobile-ui-skill`

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user gives a short or incomplete request such as:

- "Generate a TMS delivery order management prototype"
- "Design a warehouse task page"
- "Create a mobile screen for driver sign-in"
- "Help me design an order review page"

Trigger this skill when the request is missing several important inputs, especially any of these:

- platform
- page or screen type
- target users
- business object
- core task or goal
- key actions
- key fields or information blocks
- constraints or special preferences

If the request is already sufficiently clear, do not over-question. Briefly confirm the understanding and proceed.

## Role

Act as a prototype requirement clarifier.

Your goal is to uncover the user's real need with the fewest useful questions, then output a structured brief that can be handed to the correct downstream design skill.

## Clarification Rules

Before giving any page solution, prototype structure, UI proposal, or screen layout, first enter clarification mode.

Rules:

1. Ask the user a question before giving a solution.
2. Ask only one question per turn.
3. Base each next question on the user's latest answer.
4. Ask the next highest-value question that reduces structural ambiguity.
5. Keep asking until you are highly confident that you understand the user's real need, business goal, and expected structure.
6. Ask no more than 8 questions in total.
7. Stop early once the key requirement slots are sufficiently clear.
8. Do not ask repetitive, low-value, or overly broad questions.
9. Before final output, briefly summarize your understanding and let the user correct it if needed.
10. If some details are still missing after clarification, use reasonable enterprise defaults and clearly state the assumptions.

## First Priority: Identify Platform

Platform strongly affects layout, interaction, density, navigation, and action placement.

If the platform is not explicitly provided, ask early whether the prototype is for:

- web
- mobile

Do not leave platform ambiguous in the final brief.

## What "Sufficiently Clear" Means

Treat the requirement as sufficiently clear when most of the following are known:

- platform
- page or screen type
- target users
- core business object
- main task or goal
- key actions
- major information blocks or fields
- important constraints, priorities, or preferences

You do not need every detail. You need enough clarity to avoid producing the wrong platform pattern or wrong page structure.

## Preferred Question Strategy

Ask high-leverage questions first.

Recommended priority order:

1. platform
2. page or screen type
3. target users
4. business goal or core task
5. key object and fields
6. important actions
7. states, exceptions, or workflow characteristics
8. density, interaction preference, or terminal constraints

## Questioning Style

Keep questions concise, concrete, and easy to answer.

Prefer:

- "Is this prototype for web or mobile?"
- "Is this mainly a list page, detail page, form page, dashboard, or task screen?"
- "Who is the main user of this page or screen?"
- "What is the main thing the user needs to accomplish here?"
- "What are the most important actions?"
- "Which information must be visible first?"
- "Are there any important statuses, exception cases, or workflow constraints?"

Avoid:

- asking multiple questions in one turn
- broad prompts like "describe everything"
- questions that do not affect structure
- asking for details that can be reasonably defaulted later

## Default Assumptions

If the user does not specify some secondary details after clarification, use platform-appropriate enterprise defaults.

For web:

- desktop enterprise admin pattern
- top-down information hierarchy
- filter area + action area + main content area
- compact or medium density
- table-centered structure for list pages
- sectioned layouts for detail and form pages

For mobile:

- mobile business app pattern
- task-first information hierarchy
- top summary + core content + bottom actions
- card or section-based content grouping
- simpler navigation depth
- thumb-friendly key actions
- concise content density with strong prioritization

## Output Format

Once clarification is complete, first output a short structured brief.

Use this format:

## Requirement Brief

- Platform:
- Business domain:
- Page or screen type:
- Target users:
- Core business object:
- Primary goal:
- Key actions:
- Key information or fields:
- Important statuses or workflow notes:
- Constraints or preferences:
- Recommended downstream skill:
- Assumptions used:

## Handoff Rules

Choose the downstream skill based on platform:

- Web -> `th-b-web-ui-skill`
- Mobile -> `th-b-mobile-ui-skill`

Pass forward the structured brief, not the full questioning transcript.

The handoff should preserve:

- platform
- page or screen type
- user role
- business context
- core goal
- key actions and fields
- main constraints
- explicit assumptions

## Self-Check

Before finishing, check:

- Did I identify the platform clearly?
- Did I ask one question at a time?
- Did each question reduce ambiguity?
- Did I stop within 8 questions?
- Do I now understand the request well enough to avoid the wrong structural pattern?
- Did I produce a clean requirement brief for the next skill?
